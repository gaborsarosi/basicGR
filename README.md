# basicGR
A Mathematica notebook for calculating basic quantities in General Relativity.

There are many third party notebooks and packages for GR calculations, but one always likes to use their own to make sure what's going on under the hood. This one has minimal footprint to get you started: no new objects, just good old Mathematica Lists and functions. It served me well during my research career.

Content:
- Levi-Civita connection
- Riemann tensor, Ricci Tensor, Ricci scalar
- Covariant derivative (vectors and tensors)
- Basic tensor manipulations: pulling indices with a metric, contracting indices between two tensors.
